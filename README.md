## About

This application provides a generic implementation of how to recover RDL files from an instance of the ReportServer database.  

For the application to work it needs the database connection string to be ammended with your server details and the path you want the RDL file(s) to be exported to.

A trusted connection is used and the application assumes that the user has permission to read from the relevant ReportServer database and to write files to the path
that they specify.
